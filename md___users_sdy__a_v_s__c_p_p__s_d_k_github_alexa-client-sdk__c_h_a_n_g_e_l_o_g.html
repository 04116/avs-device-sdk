<ul>
<li><b>Enhancements</b><ul>
<li>ContextManager now passes the namespace/name of the desired state to StateProviderInterface::provideState(). This is helpful when a single StateProvider object provides multiple states, and needs to know which one ContextManager is asking for.</li>
<li>The mime parser was hardened against duplicate boundaries.</li>
<li>Added functionality to add and remove AudioPlayer observers to the DefaultClient.</li>
<li>Unit tests for Alerts were added.</li>
<li>Added en-IN, en-CA and ja-JP to the SampleApp locale selection menu.</li>
<li>Added default alert and timer audio data to the SDK SampleApp. There is no longer a requirement to download these audio files and configure them in the json configuration file.</li>
<li>Added support in SDS Reader and AttachmentReader for seeking into the future. This allows a reader to move to an index which has not yet arrived in the SDS and poll/block until it arrives.</li>
<li>Added support for blocking Writers in the SharedDataStream class.</li>
<li>Changed the default status code sent by MessageRequestObserverInterface::onSendCompleted() to SERVER_OTHER_ERROR, and mapped HTTP code 500 to SERVER_INTERNAL_ERROR_V2.</li>
<li>Added support for parsing stream duration out of playlists.</li>
<li>Added a configuration option ("sampleApp":"displayCardsSupported") that allows the displaying of display cards to be enabled or disabled.</li>
<li>Named Timers and Reminders have been updated to fall back to the on-device background audio sound when cloud urls cannot be accessed or rendered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Bug Fixes</b><ul>
<li>Removed floating point dependencies from core SDK libraries.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in SpeechSynthesizer where it's erroneously calling stop more than once.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in ContentFetcher where it could hang during destruction until an active GET request completed.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple of parsing bugs in LibCurlHttpContentFetcher related to case-sensitivity and mime-type handling.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where MediaPlayerObserverInterface::onPlaybackResumed() wasn't being called after resuming from a pause with a pending play/resume.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in LibCurlContentFetcher where it could error out if data is written to the SDS faster than it is consumed.</li>
<li>The GStreamer-based MediaPlayer reference implementation now uses the ACL HTTP configured client.<ul>
<li>An API change has been made to MediaPlayerInterface::setSource(). This method now takes in an optional offset as well to allow for immediately streaming to the offset if possible.</li>
<li>Next and Previous buttons now work with Audible.</li>
<li>Pandora resume stuttering is addressed.</li>
<li>Pausing and resuming Amazon music no longer seeks back to the beginning of the song.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>libcurl CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL option is set to 1 (<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL.html">https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL.html</a>) to avoid crashes observed in SampleApp.</li>
<li>Fixed the timing of the PlaybackReportIntervalEvent and PlaybackReportDelayEvent as specified in the directives.</li>
<li>Fixed potential deadlocks in MediaPlayer during shutdown related to queued callbacks.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in MediaPlayer that could occur if the network is disconnected during playback.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where music could keep playing while Alexa is speaking.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which was causing problems with pause/resume and next/previous with Amazon Music.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where music could briefly start playing between speaks.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where HLS playlists would stop streaming after the initial playlist had been played to completion.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Audible playback could not advance to the next chapter.</li>
<li>Fixed some occurrences of SDK entering the IDLE state during the transition between Listening and Speaking states.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where PlaybackFinished events were not reporting the correct offset.<ul>
<li>An API change has been made to MediaPlayerInterface::getOffset(). This method is now required to return the final offset when called after playback has stopped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where AIP was erroneously resetting its state upon getting a cancelDirective() callback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Known Issues</b><ul>
<li>Capability agent for Notifications is not included in this release.</li>
<li><code>ACL</code>'s asynchronous receipt of audio attachments may manage resources poorly in scenarios where attachments are received but not consumed.</li>
<li>GUI cards don't show for Kindle.</li>
<li>The new SpeechSynthesizerState state values GAINING_FOCUS and LOSING_FOCUS were added as part of a work-around. The will likely be removed in subsequent releases.</li>
<li>With the gstreamer-based MediaPlayer, after muting and unmuting, the next item starts playing rather than continuing with the current item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>[1.2.1] - 2017-11-16</h3>

<li>Bug fix for <a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/189">issue #189</a> - Fixed a race condition in the <code>Timer</code> class that sometimes caused <code>SpeechSynthesizer</code> to get stuck in the "Speaking" state.</li>
<li>Bug fix for a race condition that caused <code>SpeechSynthesizer</code> to ignore subsequent <code>Speak</code> directives.</li>
<li>Bug fix for corrupted mime attachments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>[1.2.0] - 2017-10-27</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhancements</b><ul>
<li>Updated MediaPlayer to solve stability issues</li>
<li>All capability agents were refined to work with the updated MediaPlayer</li>
<li>Added the TemplateRuntime capability agent</li>
<li>Added the SpeakerManager capability agent</li>
<li>Added a configuration option ("sampleApp":"endpoint") that allows the endpoint that SampleApp connects to to be specified without changing code or rebuilding</li>
<li>Added very verbose capture of libcurl debug information</li>
<li>Added an observer interface to observer audio state changes from AudioPlayer</li>
<li>Added support for StreamMetadataExtracted Event. Stream tags found in the stream are represented in JSON and sent to AVS</li>
<li>Added to the SampleApp a simple GuiRenderer as an observer to the TemplateRuntime Capability Agent</li>
<li>Moved shared libcurl functionality to AVSCommon/Utils</li>
<li>Added a CMake option to exclude tests from the "make all" build. Use "cmake &lt;absolute-path-to-source&gt;
  -DACSDK_EXCLUDE_TEST_FROM_ALL=ON" to enable it. When this option is enabled "make unit" and "make integration" still could be used to build and run the tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Bug fixes</b>:<ul>
<li>Previously scheduled alerts now play following a restart</li>
<li>General stability fixes</li>
<li>Bug fix for CertifiedSender blocking forever if the network goes down while it's trying to send a message to AVS</li>
<li>Fixes for known issue of Alerts integration tests fail: AlertsTest.UserLongUnrelatedBargeInOnActiveTimer and AlertsTest.handleOneTimerWithVocalStop</li>
<li>Attempting to end a tap-to-talk interaction with the tap-to-talk button wouldn't work</li>
<li>SharedDataStream could encounter a race condition due to a combination of a blocking Reader and a Writer closing before writing any data</li>
<li>Bug-fix for the ordering of notifications within alerts scheduling. This fixes the issue where a local-stop on an alert would also stop a subsequent alert if it were to begin without delay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Known Issues</b></li>
<li>Capability agent for Notifications is not included in this release</li>
<li>Inconsistent playback behavior when resuming content ("Alexa, pause." / "Alexa, resume."). Specifically, handling playback offsets, which causes the content to play from the start. This behavior is also occasionally seen with "Next" / "Previous".</li>
<li><code>ACL</code>'s asynchronous receipt of audio attachments may manage resources poorly in scenarios where attachments are received but not consumed.</li>
<li>Music playback failures may result in an error Text to Speech being rendered repeatedly</li>
<li>Reminders and named timers don't sound when there is no connection</li>
<li>GUI cards don't show for Kindle</li>
</ul>

<h3>[1.0.2] - 2017-08-23</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed code from AIP which propagates ExpectSpeech initiator strings to subsequent Recognize events. This code will be re-introduced when AVS starts sending initiator strings.</li>
</ul>

<li>The <code>Sample App</code> has been updated with several small fixes and improvements.</li>
<li><code>ADSL</code> was updated such that all directives are now blocked while the handling of previous <code>SpeechSynthesizer.Speak</code> directives complete. Because any directive may now be blocked, the <code>preHandleDirective() / handleDirective()</code> path is now used for handling all directives.</li>
<li>Fixes for the following GitHub issues:<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexa/alexa-client-sdk/issues/44">EXPECTING_SPEECH + SPEAK directive simultaneously on multi-turn conversation</a>.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><code>AudioPlayer</code><ul>
<li>Amazon Music, TuneIn, and SiriusXM are not supported in this release.</li>
<li>Our parsing of urls currently depends upon GNOME/totem-pl-parser which only works on some Linux platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>AlertsCapabilityAgent</code><ul>
<li>Satisfies the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/timers-and-alarms-conceptual-overview">AVS specification</a> except for sending retrospective Events. For example, sending <code>AlertStarted</code> Event for an Alert which rendered when there was no internet connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Sample App</code>:<ul>
<li>Any connection loss during the <code>Listening</code> state keeps the app stuck in that state, unless the ongoing interaction is manually stopped by the user.</li>
<li>The user must wait several seconds after starting up the sample app before the sample app is properly usable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Tests</code>:<ul>

<ul>
<li>Added a sample app that leverages the SDK.</li>
<li>Added <code>Alerts</code> capability agent.</li>
<li>Added the <code>DefaultClient</code> class.</li>
<li>Added the following classes to support directives and events in the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system"><code>System</code> interface</a>: <code>StateSynchronizer</code>, <code>EndpointHandler</code>, and <code>ExceptionEncounteredSender</code>.</li>
<li>Added unit tests for <code>ACL</code>.</li>
<li>Updated <code>MediaPlayer</code> to play local files given an <code>std::istream</code>.</li>
<li>Changed build configuration from <code>Debug</code> to <code>Release</code>.</li>
<li>Removed <code>DeprecatedLogger</code> class.</li>
<li>Known Issues:<ul>
<li><code>MediaPlayer</code>: Our <code>GStreamer</code> based implementation of <code>MediaPlayer</code> is not fully robust, and may result in fatal runtime errors, under the following conditions:<ul>
<li>Attempting to play multiple simultaneous audio streams</li>
<li>Calling <code>MediaPlayer::play()</code> and <code>MediaPlayer::stop()</code> when the MediaPlayer is already playing or stopped, respectively.</li>

<li>Alerts do not play in the background when Alexa is speaking, but will continue playing after Alexa stops speaking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Sample App</code>:<ul>
<li>Without the refresh token being filled out in the JSON file, the sample app crashes on start up.</li>
<li>Any connection loss during the <code>Listening</code> state keeps the app stuck in that state, unless the ongoing interaction is manually stopped by the user.</li>
<li>At the end of a shopping list with more than 5 items, the interaction in which Alexa asks the user if he/she would like to hear more does not finish properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Tests</code>:</p><ul>

<li>Added <code>SpeechSynthesizer</code>, an implementation of the <code>SpeechRecognizer</code> capability agent.</li>
<li>Implemented a reference <code>MediaPlayer</code> based on <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> for audio playback.</li>
<li>Added <code>MediaPlayerInterface</code> that allows you to implement your own media player.</li>
<li>Updated <code>ACL</code> to support asynchronous receipt of audio attachments from AVS.</li>
<li>Bug Fixes:<ul>
<li>Some intermittent unit test failures were fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known Issues:<ul>
<li><code>ACL</code>'s asynchronous receipt of audio attachments may manage resources poorly in scenarios where attachments are received but not consumed.</li>
<li>When an <code>AttachmentReader</code> does not deliver data for prolonged periods <code>MediaPlayer</code> may not resume playing the delayed audio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.3.0] - 2017-05-17</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added the <code>CapabilityAgent</code> base class that is used to build capability agent implementations.</li>
<li>Added <code>ContextManager</code>, a component that allows multiple capability agents to store and access state. These Events include <code>Context</code>, which is used to communicate the state of each capability agent to AVS in the following Events:<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/speechrecognizer#recognize"><code>Recognize</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#playcommandissued"><code>PlayCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#pausecommandissued"><code>PauseCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#nextcommandissued"><code>NextCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#previouscommandissued"><code>PreviousCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system#synchronizestate"><code>SynchronizeState</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system#exceptionencountered"><code>ExceptionEncountered</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added <code>SharedDataStream</code> (SDS) to asynchronously communicate data between a local reader and writer.</li>
<li>Added <code>AudioInputProcessor</code> (AIP), an implementation of a <code>SpeechRecognizer</code> capability agent.</li>
<li>Added WakeWord Detector (WWD), which recognizes keywords in audio streams. [0.3.0] implements a wrapper for KITT.ai.</li>
<li>Added a new implementation of <code>AttachmentManager</code> and associated classes for use with SDS.</li>
<li>Updated <code>ACL</code> to support asynchronously sending audio to AVS.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.2.1] - 2017-05-03</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the configuration file <code>AuthDelegate.config</code> with <code>AlexaClientSDKConfig.json</code>.</li>
<li>Added the ability to specify a <code>CURLOPT_CAPATH</code> value to be used when libcurl is used by ACL and AuthDelegate. See See Appendix C in the README for details.</li>
<li>Changes to ADSL interfaces:<ul>
<li>The [0.2.0] interface for registering directive handlers (<code>DirectiveSequencer::setDirectiveHandlers()</code>) was problematic because it canceled the ongoing processing of directives and dropped further directives until it completed. The revised API makes the operation immediate without canceling or dropping any handling. However, it does create the possibility that <code>DirectiveHandlerInterface</code> methods <code>preHandleDirective()</code> and <code>handleDirective()</code> may be called on different handlers for the same directive.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveSequencerInterface::setDirectiveHandlers()</code> was replaced by <code>addDirectiveHandlers()</code> and <code>removeDirectiveHandlers()</code>.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="namespace_auth_server.html#a44a37005c847e1d50bcfc24315fd50ff">DirectiveHandlerInterface::shutdown()</a></code> was replaced with <code>onDeregistered()</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::preHandleDirective()</code> now takes a <code>std::unique_ptr</code> instead of a <code>std::shared_ptr</code> to <code>DirectiveHandlerResultInterface</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::handleDirective()</code> now returns a bool indicating if the handler recognizes the <code>messageId</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug fixes:<ul>
<li>ACL and AuthDelegate now require TLSv1.2.</li>
<li><code>onDirective()</code> now sends <code>ExceptionEncountered</code> for unhandled directives.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="namespace_auth_server.html#a44a37005c847e1d50bcfc24315fd50ff">DirectiveSequencer::shutdown()</a></code> no longer sends <code>ExceptionEncountered()</code> for queued directives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.2.0] - 2017-03-27 (patch)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added memory profiling for ACL and ADSL. See Appendix A in the README.</li>
<li>Added a command to build the API documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.2.0] - 2017-03-09</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>Alexa Directive Sequencer Library</code> (ADSL) and <code>Alexa Focus Manager Library</code> (AMFL).</li>
<li>CMake build types and options have been updated.</li>
<li>Documentation for libcurl optimization included.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.1.0] - 2017-02-10</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initial release of the <code>Alexa Communications Library</code> (ACL), a component which manages network connectivity with AVS, and <code>AuthDelegate</code>, a component which handles user authorization with AVS. </li>
</ul>
